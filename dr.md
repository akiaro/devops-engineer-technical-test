# Disaster Recovery Strategy

## Backup Strategy
- Regular backups of the Cloud SQL database using automated backups.
- Store backups in Google Cloud Storage with versioning enabled.

## Recovery Plan
1. Identify the failure: Monitor logs and alerts to detect service outages.
2. Restore from Backup: Use the latest backup to restore the Cloud SQL instance.
3. Failover: Use Cloud Runâ€™s ability to quickly deploy a new instance in another region if necessary.

## Testing
- Conduct regular DR drills to ensure that backup and recovery processes work as intended.
